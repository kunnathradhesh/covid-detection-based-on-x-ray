COVID-19 is an infectious and deadly type of disease that has affected millions of people
in the world. It has shown the deadly nature by affecting the respiratory system. Clinical study
reveals that infected people may experience symptoms that include fever, dry cough, headache,
and respiratory illness. At the same time, the lungs, respiratory tract gets infected badly with the
virus infection. So the lungs can be a prominent organ to diagnose the disease. Therefore,
traditional RT-PCR methodology is used for clinical diagnosis. But it takes a few hours to get the
results of the patient. So to get the result quickly and acquiring the highest accuracy when
predicting the infected person is affected with COVID-19 or not, Chest X-Rays can be used to
detect the infected part of the lungs using Convolution Neural Network(CNN).CNN based image
augmentation is used for the detection of COVID-19. Using the dataset that is available in the
public repository Consisting of Normal Chest X-Rays and COVID positive Chest X-Rays. Using
tensor flow, Keras to build the model with multiple CNN layers consisting of an activation
function\, max pooling, optimizer as Adam, followed by classification layer which used sigmoid
as the activation function in the final layer. The model has performed better when compared to the
existing state of art algorithms. The proposed model has obtained an accuracy of 98.6%, Thus the
designed model is generalized and shall be able to detect the disease with maximum accuracy.
